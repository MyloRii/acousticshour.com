				<h1>How is everything here free?</h1>
				<p>
				I've made this whole website and my video lessons just to invest my khowledge in people who are struggling to learn how to play guitar.
				This was my only idea which pushed me through a bunch of difficulties on my way of providing all this content.
				My videos are monetised by using advertising so I kindly ask you to disable adblockers so I can have at least something as a payment for my work.
				Also, there maybe some of you who will choose to donate money to support me generating this content.
				There is only one option available to make a donation via Webmoney because I live in Ukraine where we don't have services like Paypal. 
				My webmoney accounts can be found at the home page in 'about' section.

				<h1>What experience do you have?</h1>
				<p>
				I've started playing guitar since I was 14 years old. I have no special education and I don't believe that any of you should have one.
				I learned how to play guitar by myself playing only songs that I love. I truly believe this is the only way
				to recieve pleasure of the process of study. Also, I had a couple of rock bands where I was songwriter, guitar player and lead singer. If you stick with my tutorials
				I promise that at one point you'll be able to play all of the songs you love. Although I didn't like and never really needed any music theory I will explain you some
				in case you want to write your own songs.

				<h1>Is it possible to make a request for a song?</h1>
				<p>Yes! Feel free to make as many requests as you like in the comments section below my YouTube videos. 
				I usually read every single comment made.
				Please note that I only play and make tutorials for songs of these music genres: Indie Rock, Britpop, Post Punk, Classic Rock and all related genres.
				Also, I'm a big fan of acoustic guitar and songs made with acoustic guitar.
				So, in case your request matches with my taste we both will recieve a lot of pleasure. 
				If you wish to make a request please link a video to your request message. 
				This way I'll be able to quickly find, listen and assess the song to see if it is doable within the constraints that I have.
